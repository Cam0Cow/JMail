# JMail
A new email client/server network

This is supposed to be a private project, but I was not intending to
pay money for this so... yeah.

Jmail is an open source e-mail emulator, with client/server capabillities. This does not comply with any currently available email protocols.

WARNING!!!
Do not transfer any important or private information with this just yet; Encryption is still WIP; Well, the whole damn thing is a WIP.
